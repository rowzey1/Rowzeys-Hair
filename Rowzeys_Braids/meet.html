							<p>Hello, I'm Rosy the founder of Rowzey's Hair. I am a home based stylist in Lynn, MA with over 10 years of professional esperience in the haircare industry. My journey in the world of haircare began as a child when i would spend time afterschool in my cousins salon. I knew i had a passion for hair, and would voulunteer to help out with little tasks around the shop. I quickly took on more client facing roles as i got older, and began my professional journey while still attending highschool.Since then, Iâ€™ve been committed to helping individuals express their unique styles while promoting healthy hair practices.</p>
							<p>Im experienced in a wide range of styles, including knotless braids, cornrows, twists, sew ins, and ponytail extensions. My goal is to create stunning, personalized looks that not only enhance your beauty but also protect your natural hair. I believe that every hairstyle tells a story, and I take pride in crafting styles that reflect your personality and lifestyle.</p>
							<p>Over the years, I have built a strong base of loyal, and satisfied clientele. What sets me apart is my attention to detail and commitment to providing a comfortable, welcoming experience for my clients. I understand that hair is not just a part of who we are but also a form of self-expression. That's why I work closely with each client to understand their vision and ensure they leave my chair feeling confident and beautiful. </p>
							<p> Whether you're looking for a protective style, a bold new look, or just want to pamper yourself, I'm here to help you achieve your hair goals. Let's embark on this creative journey together and celebrate the beauty of your natural hair!</p>
